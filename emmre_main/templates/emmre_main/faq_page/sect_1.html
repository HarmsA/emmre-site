                We’ve all done it.  We’ve got a bunch of messages coming in from our team that are actually tasks in disgues.
                Our only defense to not forget them is to mark them “unread.”

                With Emmre, simply click “Convert to Task” and those messages will get sent right to your task list and you
                can go on with your day knowing that task will not be missed!
